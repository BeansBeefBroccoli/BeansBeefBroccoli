      Before submitting a bug report, please make sure you have read and filled out this form entirely, and that:
      - Your bug isn't a vanilla bug or another mod's bug
      - Your issue isn't a duplicate (make sure to use the search function!)

      **Don't forget to give your issue a descriptive title.** "It Crashes" isn't useful information, and it's annoying for the devs.
